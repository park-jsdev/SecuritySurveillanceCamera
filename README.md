# Security Surveillance Camera
This project is a circuit design of a basic surveillance camera, using the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit. It provides a starting point for a 'DIY' home security system from components that can be affordably acquired. It is intended for engineering students of an undergraduate level, or hobby roboticists or engineers. 

The motivation for this project was to gain introductory learning via an end-to-end project in the fields of robotics, electronics, signals intelligence, security, and IoT. While the first iteration is basic, it provides groundwork that can be built on in the future, for example, the Serial monitor capabilities using the ultrasonic sensor can be extended to incorporate IoT data mining or ML techniques for human recognition. If a USB shield is acquired, the circuit can be connected to a webcam, or mobile phone, to add video capabilities, and likely can be integrated with a mobile application.

I was able to practice systems thinking and active learning while learning Arduino and circuit design during this project. During the implementation, I encountered for the first time the added dimension of complexity in programming for physical movement. It is difficult to fabricate or customize components to produce the type of movement one might expect while programming, or simulating. One will likely encounter unanticipated errors in movement, or limitations in hardware components, and it is a fun task to try to come up with novel solutions to sensors, actuators, or applications of components working together.

This is a good introductory project for an undergraduate student or hobbyist, as it provides both learning value, and real-world value by providing home security, or data collection mechanisms.
